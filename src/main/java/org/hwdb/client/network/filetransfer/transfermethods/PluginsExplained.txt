README

This file talks all about the Syncany http://www.syncany.org/ plugin architecture.

One of the things I want to do in the future is remove the plugin feature and just leave the file methods permently plugged in.

To upload/download a file using a plugin:
    - Create a Connection object
    - Using that Connection object, create a Transfer Manager object.
    - Pass in a RemoteFile object into upload() and download() (and delete() ect.) Methods.
