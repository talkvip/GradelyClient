PACKAGES
-----------------------------------------------------------

org.gradely.client
    - utilties shared by large sections of the program
    - the main class

config: handles the configuration of the project

database: handles connections to the database, Apache Derby. Includes a connection pool, and other various utilties.

gui: Classes that make up the graphical user interface and system tray.

logging: Logs all sorts of cool stuff. Based on http://www.tinylog.org

localchanges: classes in this package watch the local filesystem and then, when a change is detected, figure out how to notify everyone.

deduplication: Integrated tightly with localchanges. Deals with the datadeduplication/diff files and file types. The deduplication files consist of a list of blocks of the file and their Adler32 hashsums.


network: Takes care of contacting the Gradely custom server.
   filetransfer: Transfers (sometimes large) files up and down from remote storage. All file transfer takes place through the FileTransferQueue.
        transfermethods: Ways to transfer the files.
   remotechanges: When the server notifies of a new change to the filesystem, the classes in here figure out how to handle the command and download the appropriate file.
