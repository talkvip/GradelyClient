
RDiff is a delta compression format designed to be completely reversible. It is possible to go from file A to file B as well as go from file B to file A.
Inspired by the rsync communication algorithm, this, combined with chucking the file and taking hashsums, allows for the complete changes to a file to be uploaded to a server in one fell swoop as well as keeping the local cache on the local machine minimal. 
On the server machine a single copy of each chunk is stored. When a chunk is updated, a diff file is also stored for the chunk, assuming that the chuck has not changed too much. Diff files will modify diff files until the original binary chunk is reached. This trades file storage for processing power. 
On the client, a copy of chunks not already stores in complete form are stored along with the diff files. This makes generating the new diff very simple and quick, but it does use some more storage space. The client also has the privilege of applying diffs to the files, keeping the extra processing from the server. 
There are three commands with the rdiff algorithm.
-	Insert: Inserts bytes into the file. Uses the original, unmodified file as its coordinate system for all operations.
-	Delete: Deletes a number of bytes. Uses the file after all insertions as its coordinate system.
-	Run: An insert operation, but inserts the same byte multiple times.
